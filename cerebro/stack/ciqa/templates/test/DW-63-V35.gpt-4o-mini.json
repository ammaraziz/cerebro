On the other hand, *Roseolovirus humanbeta6b*, a member of the Roseolovirus genus, is closely related to human herpesviruses and is known for causing neurological complications, especially in immunocompromised individuals. In this case, metagenomic profiling provided sufficient evidence for potential infectious involvement, with target list data specifically supporting the presence of *Roseolovirus*.

This virus, related to human herpesviruses, is associated with neurological complications, particularly in individuals with compromised immune systems, making it a pertinent consideration given the clinical presentation. While other candidates, such as *Mardivirus columbidalpha1*, could point to uncommonly recognized zoonotic diseases, their documented human associations are rare and less relevant in this context. The metagenomic data from the target list strongly supports the presence of *Roseolovirus*, affirming its role as the probable infectious agent, while the concern over potential skin microbiome contamination was mitigated due to strong clinical indicators correlating with *Roseolovirus* infection.
