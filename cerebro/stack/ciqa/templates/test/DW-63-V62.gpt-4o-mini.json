While these taxa are not commonly associated with such clinical presentations traditionally, their detection in this sterile sample type raises concerns, particularly considering potential contamination from the skin microbiome and sample handling. 'Hylemonella delicata' is a recently described genus, and its clinical significance remains to be fully elucidated; however, it has been associated with human infections in rare instances. 'Halomonas alkalicola' is known primarily in the context of saline environments and its pathogenic role in humans is unclear, though some strains have shown a capacity for opportunistic infections. 'Acinetobacter junii', part of a genus often linked to nosocomial infections, has more established associations with human disease, particularly in immunocompromised individuals. Given the metagenomic evidence indicating the presence of these pathogens, albeit likely at below-threshold levels, there is enough clinical relevance to warrant consideration of these taxa as potential contributing factors to the patient’s symptoms, while also acknowledging the need for further investigation into the potential for contamination.",
