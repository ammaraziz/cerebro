Betapolyomavirus secuhominis, part of the Polyomaviridae family, is generally considered an opportunistic pathogen, with rare cases documented in the literature associating it with central nervous system infections. The metagenomic profiling has provided supportive evidence for its presence, underscoring its relevance in this clinical scenario while also considering the need to rule out potential contamination from skin microbiome sources during sample handling. Given the absence of tumor signals in the analysis and the clinical significance of identifying an infectious agent, this finding warrants further investigation to determine the causative association between the detected pathogen and the patient's neurological symptoms.",
