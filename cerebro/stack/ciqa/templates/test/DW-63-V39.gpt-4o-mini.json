Mastadenovirus caesari, while less commonly associated with human disease, might play a role as a viral pathogen in rare cases, and the Orthopoxviruses are known to cause various infections in humans, including those leading to neurological manifestations. The metagenomic profiling presents robust evidence for these viruses, supporting their potential role, notwithstanding the risk of contamination from the skin microbiome and handling.

The strength of the metagenomic profiling evidence supporting its presence is significant, indicating that it may play a pivotal role in the patient's condition.
