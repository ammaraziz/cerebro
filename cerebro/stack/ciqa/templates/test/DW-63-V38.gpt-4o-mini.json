While traditionally recognized as a respiratory tract pathogen, *H. influenzae* can also be implicated in central nervous system infections, such as meningitis or encephalitis, particularly in pediatric populations or immunocompromised individuals. The metagenomic profiling has shown sufficient evidence for *H. influenzae* presence below the threshold of typical infectious involvement, indicating a potential pathogen despite the lack of stronger indicators of direct infection from above-threshold data. Its identification here may warrant further investigation into its clinical implications, particularly given the patient's symptoms and the potential for this pathogen to contribute to neuroinflammatory processes. The risk of contamination from handling or sampling sites needs to be considered; however, the presence of *H. influenzae* aligns with the rare possibility of infectious agents affecting the neurological status of the patient.",
