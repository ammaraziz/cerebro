The presence of this virus in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sample, alongside the patient's neuroinflammatory presentation, suggests a potential viral etiology warranting further investigation, despite the overall low incidence of *Mastadenoviruses* in such contexts. The metagenomic profiling provides adequate support for a viral infection given the clinical symptoms and sample type, enhancing the diagnostic relevance of this finding. As contamination from skin microbiome or handling may have occurred, care must be taken in interpreting the significance of the viral signal detected; nonetheless, *Mastadenovirus caesari* remains a plausible infectious agent in this clinical scenario, notably when balancing potential contamination against the patient's symptoms.",
