While the evidence from below-threshold data supports an infectious diagnosis, the overall microbial profile indicates diversity typically associated with either contamination or non-pathogenic behavior in the context of neurological symptoms. Notably, species such as *Moraxella* and *Acinetobacter* are skin commensals and can be involved in infections but are less commonly implicated in spontaneous meningitis.

The strength of the profiling evidence supports the possibility of infection, particularly considering that *Moraxella* species are not commonly associated with contamination in sterile neurological samples, making this candidate notable. Furthermore, *Moraxella osloensis* has a documented history of causing rare but significant human infections, which distinguishes it from other identified taxa that are more frequently regarded as contaminants.
