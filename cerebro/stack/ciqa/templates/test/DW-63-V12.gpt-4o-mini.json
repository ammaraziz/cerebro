Mastadenovirus caesari, while less commonly implicated in such clinical presentations, can also cause central nervous system infections and has been noted in rare cases. Metagenomic profiling provided evidence supporting an infectious diagnosis, suggesting that these taxa, despite potentially being rare in this clinical scenario, warrant further investigation due to their association with significant health impacts in the appropriate clinical context.
